    <h1 id="main-title">About me</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Ryan!</h2>
    <p>I'm working towards becoming a web developer, starting with
      front-end development. Right now, I'm focused on learning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
      and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and once I feel more confident
      with them, I'll move on to JavaScript before learning about frameworks and libraries such as React.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first got into coding while I was still working, learning HTML and CSS in my spare time. 
      Unfortunately, due to medical reasons I had to leave my job. I ended up switching focus for a while
      and completed a Level 2 Business Administration qualification as well as learning programs like 
      Microsoft Word, Excel and Outlook to try and get into office work, since most of my experience 
      was in manual labour.
    </p>
    <p>After I lost my job, I applied to hundreds of office roles and spoke to every
      local recruitment agencies I could. The response was always the same; not enough
      experience, even for jobs I was lucky enough to interview for. That's when I stepped back
      and thought seriously about what I really wanted. I realised that with web development, not
      only do I enjoy it, but it's also something I can grow in by building my own experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now I'm putting my energy into learning web development properly. 
      It's not easy, but it's something I enjoy and see a future in, and that makes
      it worth it.
